-- TEMPORARY: Disable RLS on assignments table to test if this fixes the 400 errors
-- This is just for testing - we'll re-enable with a working policy once we understand the issue

BEGIN;

-- Disable RLS on assignments table completely
ALTER TABLE public.assignments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS assignments_access ON public.assignments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS assignments_manage ON public.assignments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS assignments_teacher_access ON public.assignments;

-- TEST AFTER APPLYING:
-- 1. Teacher dashboard should load assignments without 400 errors
-- 2. This temporarily removes security but helps us isolate the issue
-- 3. We can re-enable RLS with a working policy once we understand what's wrong

-- NOTE: This is just for debugging - assignments table will be unsecured temporarily
