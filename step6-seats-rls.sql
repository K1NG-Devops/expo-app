-- FINAL TEST POINTS after applying:
-- 1. âœ… SEAT MANAGEMENT PAGE - This is the big test!
--    - Should show "All Teachers (2)" 
--    - katso@youngeagles.org.za should show "Has seat [Revoke]"
--    - king@youngeagles.org.za should show "No seat [Assign Seat]"
--    - Should show "Seats: 1/3"
--
-- 2. âœ… Assign/revoke seat functionality works?
-- 3. âœ… Principal can see seat assignments?  
-- 4. âœ… Teachers can see their own seat status?
-- 5. âœ… No 500 errors anywhere in the app?

-- If the seat management page breaks or shows "All Teachers (0)" again:
-- ALTER TABLE public.subscription_seats DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- If everything works perfectly, congratulations! 
-- You now have full RLS security with working functionality! ðŸŽ‰
