# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Quality Assurance Process
**CRITICAL**: Before confirming any section or task as complete, always:
1. Run linting/type checking: `npm run lint` or `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. Attempt to build the project: `npx expo start` or equivalent
3. Resolve any compilation errors, missing dependencies, or type issues
4. Only mark tasks complete after successful build verification

This prevents shipping broken code and ensures all dependencies are properly installed.

Authoritative, repeatable rules to prevent regressions in dev and CI. Keep this file up to date as we learn.

## Environment and startup
- Use `.env.local` for local development configuration. Required keys:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - Optional monitoring: `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`
  - Ads toggle: `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ADS=1|0`
  - Header debug tools: `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEBUG_TOOLS=0|1`
- Start Metro before opening the Dev Client. Prefer:
  - `npm run start` (or `start:clear`), then `npm run open:android`, or
  - `npm run dev:android` (spawns server then opens client).
- Ensure ADB reverse is set for ports 8081 (Metro) and 8083 (Dev server): `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081 && adb reverse tcp:8083 tcp:8083`.

## Supabase auth
- Additional Redirect URLs in Supabase MUST include: `exp+exp-final://auth-callback`.
- Always pass `emailRedirectTo = Linking.createURL('/auth-callback')` with `signInWithOtp` so magic links return to the app.
- Email templates must include the 6‑digit token: `{{ .Token }}`.
- Route after login via the gate: `profiles-gate` calls `routeAfterLogin()` to select dashboard by role (user_metadata.role or profiles.role) and optional `preschool_id`.
- Persist sessions with `expo-secure-store`. After adding new native modules, rebuild the dev client.

## Monitoring
- Sentry and PostHog are opt‑in via env keys. Do not hardcode keys.
- Use `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEBUG_TOOLS=1` only in dev to expose test buttons that send telemetry events.

## UI/UX guards
- Every form MUST use the keyboard‑aware wrapper `KeyboardScreen` to avoid hidden inputs on focus.
- Dev headers are themed dark for consistency; production headers can be hidden or customized.

## Ads (development only)
- Use `react-native-google-mobile-ads` with Google TEST IDs in dev. We must not ship test IDs in production.
- Android Manifest MUST define: `<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID" android:value="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713" tools:replace="android:value"/>` to avoid manifest merge conflicts.
- Only render ads when `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ADS=1`. Default should be safe in dev.

## Package/version hygiene
- Never pin to non‑existent package versions. Before adding a library, check the registry:
  - `npm view <package> version` or `npm view <package> versions --json`
- `expo-ads-admob` is deprecated for current SDKs — use `react-native-google-mobile-ads` instead.
- If install errors occur, prefer a clean install: remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, run `npm cache verify`, then `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

## Android build guards
- If you see manifest merge failures for Google Mobile Ads APPLICATION_ID, add `tools:replace="android:value"` to the `<meta-data>` entry and include the `xmlns:tools` namespace on the `<manifest>` tag.
- After adding any new native modules (SecureStore, Sentry, PostHog, Google Mobile Ads), run `npx expo run:android` to rebuild the dev client.
- **CRITICAL**: Always rebuild the APK when adding new modules or making significant changes to avoid module resolution errors. Use `npx expo run:android --clear` for a clean rebuild.
- **MODULE SAFETY RULE**: Before testing new features, especially after adding dependencies, run a fresh APK build to prevent runtime module errors and ensure proper native module linking.
- **CODE QUALITY GATE**: Always run `npm run typecheck` and lint checks after every major file/code change and before building. No builds without clean type checking.

## Known device/system log noise
- System logs like `E/UxUtility: notifyAppState error = NULL` and `E/libPowerHal: ...` are device/SoC power subsystem messages and not app failures. Ignore unless accompanied by app stack traces.
- `DevLauncherErrorActivity` indicates the app couldn’t reach Metro. Fix by ensuring the dev server is running and ADB reverse is set; use `npm run dev:android`.

## Release safety
- Do not enable production ads or analytics without explicit env keys and review.
- Ensure we never commit secrets (env files are git‑ignored by default).

## Critical Production Constraints [NONNEGOTIABLE]
(Maintained from existing rules)

- No database resets. All schema changes via migrations only
- No mock data in DB or code. Always handle empty/loading/error states
- Do not modify working auth configuration (contexts/SimpleWorkingAuth.tsx)
- RLS must remain secure and enforced for all tenant data access
- **DATABASE SCHEMA FLEXIBILITY**: If code references a table or column that doesn't exist in the database, the missing table/column should be created via migration or manual SQL - the application code should NOT be changed to accommodate missing database schema. This ensures forward compatibility and allows the app to work with evolving database structures.

AI and secrets hardening
- Do not call Anthropic from the client. All AI requests must go through Supabase Edge Function: functions/v1/ai-proxy
- Never bundle AI keys. Use server-side env (SERVER_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) in edge functions only
- All AI usage must be logged server-side to ai_usage_logs with: user_id, feature, created_at, tokens_used, cost_usd (if known)
- Client-side AsyncStorage usage tracking is allowed for UX only, not billing or limits
- Enforce subscription-tier usage limits in the ai-proxy function before invoking AI
- AI prompts must be child-safe, age-appropriate, and South Africa–contextual
- Strictly redact PII before sending to AI; never include auth tokens or secrets in prompts

Server-state and offline policy
- All server state fetching must use TanStack Query. Do not fetch directly in components with useEffect
- Provide tenant-aware query keys: include preschool_id and user role in the key
- Enable offline persistence with AsyncStorage and backoff retries
- Mutations must use optimistic updates where safe, and gracefully reconcile on failure

Observability and privacy
- Sentry and PostHog are required in production builds, disabled by default in development
- Do not send PII to analytics. Identify users via hashed IDs only (e.g., sha256 of auth_user_id)
- Tag all events with: role, preschool_id (hashed), app version, platform, network status
- All critical admin and superadmin actions must write to audit_logs with timestamp and actor

RLS and data access
- Every query that reads tenant data must scope by preschool_id; prefer RPCs or views that enforce RLS
- Super-admin operations must run through server functions with service role; never bypass RLS in the client
- The client must not include service role keys. Dev-only admin client must be disabled in production

Internationalization
- All new UI strings must be externalized and routed through i18n. Default English with Afrikaans and isiZulu stubs
- AI-generated parent output should support the requested language when available

Performance and mobile-first
- Use FlashList for any list that can exceed 20 items and provide estimatedItemSize
- Prefer expo-image with caching for remote images; never render unbounded images
- Code-split heavy screens (e.g., super-admin) with lazy routing
- Keep production console output minimal and avoid noisy logging

Advertising and safety
- Ads must never render during learning interactions or on children’s content screens
- Ads are allowed for freemium only and must be educational, age-appropriate, and non-intrusive
- Ad placement must be gated behind EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ADS and use test IDs in non-production

Testing and environments
- All new features must ship with unit tests. Critical flows must have at least one e2e test
- Tests must use a local/test Supabase instance. Never run destructive tests against production
- Protect internal scripts with environment checks to prevent accidental prod operations

Notifications
- Push notifications must be opt-in, localized, and respect quiet hours where applicable
- No promotional notifications to child accounts; promotions target parents/guardians only

Security hygiene
- Never log secrets or tokens. Never output secrets to console or errors
- Use HTTPS for all network requests. Validate inputs and sanitize outputs in edge functions
- On sign-out, ensure all tokens are cleared across SecureStore and AsyncStorage (already implemented)

Implementation checklists
- AI proxy function
  - Validate user via supabase.auth.getUser() using request Authorization header
  - Load user profile and subscription tier via service role client
  - Enforce monthly usage limits based on ai_usage_logs
  - Invoke Anthropic with server-side API key
  - Insert ai_usage_logs with tokens and optional cost
  - Return minimal content payload to client
- React Query
  - Add QueryClient with sensible defaults (staleTime, retry/backoff)
  - Add persisted cache via AsyncStorage persister
  - Provide a tenant-aware QueryProvider and wrap root layout
- Monitoring
  - Initialize Sentry and PostHog on app bootstrap, gated by EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_* envs
  - Scrub PII and avoid storing sensitive payloads in breadcrumbs/events

How to propose changes
- Reference this rules.md in PR descriptions when adding AI endpoints, new data fetches, or analytics
- Include a brief "Rules compliance" section in PRs covering AI, RLS, state management, and observability

## Current Database Schema [PROTECTED]

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Production Schema - DO NOT MODIFY CODE TO MATCH MISSING SCHEMA  
**Rule**: If code references missing tables/columns, CREATE the missing schema via migration

### Core Tables Overview

**Identity & Organization**:
- `organizations` - Multi-tenant organization container
- `preschools` - Individual school instances within organizations
- `users` - All user accounts with role-based access (superadmin, principal, teacher, parent)
- `profiles` - Extended user profile information
- `subscription_plans`, `subscriptions`, `platform_subscriptions` - Billing and subscription management

**Academic Structure**:
- `age_groups` - Age-based grouping for students
- `classes` - Individual classroom instances with teacher assignments
- `students` - Student records with preschool and class associations
- `student_enrollments`, `class_assignments` - Student-class relationship management

**Learning & Assessment**:
- `lessons`, `lesson_categories` - Lesson planning and organization
- `activities`, `learning_activities` - Interactive learning activities
- `homework_assignments`, `homework_submissions` - Assignment workflow
- `assignments`, `assignment_submissions`, `assignment_grades` - Enhanced assignment system
- `assessments`, `assessment_rubrics` - Formal assessment tools
- `resources`, `resource_categories` - Educational resource library

**Communication & Engagement**:
- `messages`, `conversations`, `conversation_members` - Messaging system
- `announcements` - School-wide announcements (EXISTING - can be used for Principal Hub)
- `events`, `event_participants`, `event_updates` - Event management
- `notifications` - Push notification system

**Operations & Administration**:
- `attendance_records`, `attendance` - Student attendance tracking
- `classroom_reports` - Daily/weekly student progress reports
- `payments`, `billing_invoices` - Financial transaction management
- `enrollment_applications` - Student enrollment pipeline
- `meeting_rooms`, `meeting_sessions` - Video conferencing system

**AI & Analytics**:
- `ai_usage_logs`, `ai_services` - AI feature usage and cost tracking
- `activity_logs`, `audit_logs` - System activity and security auditing
- `platform_analytics` - System-wide metrics collection

**Principal Hub Specific Tables** (ANALYSIS):
- ✅ `announcements` - EXISTS (can use for principal announcements)
- ❌ `principal_announcements` - MISSING (could use existing announcements table)
- ❌ `financial_transactions` - MISSING (use payments table or create specific table)
- ❌ `teacher_performance_metrics` - MISSING (need to create)
- ✅ `teachers` - EXISTS (for teacher management)
- ✅ `meeting_rooms`, `meeting_sessions` - EXISTS (for principal collaboration)

### Key Relationships

```
organizations → preschools → users (principal, teachers)
                          → classes → students
                          → lessons → activities → homework_assignments
users (parents) ← students (via parent_id or student_parent_relationships)
assignments → assignment_submissions → assignment_grades
conversations → messages (multi-user messaging)
events → event_participants (school events)
```

### RLS Security Model
- All tenant data scoped by `preschool_id` or `organization_id`
- Super-admin operations bypass RLS via service role functions
- Users can only access data within their assigned preschool/organization
- Parent-student relationships managed through `student_parent_relationships`

### Missing Tables for Principal Hub MVP
Based on PRD requirements vs existing schema:

1. **teacher_performance_metrics** - Track teacher KPIs and evaluation data
2. **financial_transactions** (optional) - Could extend `payments` table instead
3. **principal_groups** - EXISTS (for principal collaboration groups)
4. **meeting_action_items** - EXISTS (for meeting follow-ups)

**Recommendation**: Use existing `announcements`, `payments`, and `teachers` tables. Only create `teacher_performance_metrics` for MVP.

## Database Migration Rules [NONNEGOTIABLE]
**CRITICAL**: ALL database changes must use Supabase migrations - NEVER run SQL directly in Supabase dashboard

- Use `npx supabase migration new <name>` to create migration files
- Use `npx supabase db push` to apply migrations to remote
- Log all migration errors and resolutions in `docs/MIGRATION_LOG.md` (copy exact error text)
- Before writing a new migration, read `docs/MIGRATION_LOG.md` and avoid prior mistakes
- Never change application code to “work around” a missing table/column; add a migration instead
- Use `npx supabase db pull` to sync remote changes to local
- **NO COPY/PASTE SQL** - All changes must be version controlled via migrations
- Keep local and remote databases in perfect sync
- Migration files must be descriptive and atomic (one logical change per migration)
- Always test migrations locally before pushing to remote

---

## Parent Linking & RLS Flow [NONNEGOTIABLE]

Goal: Allow parents/guardians to link children securely, with staff approval where needed, under strict RLS.

Schema (to be introduced via Task 4 migrations):
- student_parent_links
  - id uuid pk default gen_random_uuid()
  - student_id uuid not null
  - parent_user_id uuid not null
  - relationship_type text check (relationship_type in ('parent','guardian')) not null
  - status text check (status in ('pending','approved','denied','revoked')) not null default 'pending'
  - requested_at timestamptz not null default now()
  - approved_at timestamptz
  - approved_by uuid
  - reason text

- invite_codes
  - id uuid pk default gen_random_uuid()
  - code text unique not null
  - student_id uuid not null
  - expires_at timestamptz not null
  - created_by uuid not null
  - used_by uuid
  - used_at timestamptz

- profile_completion
  - user_id uuid primary key
  - fields_completed jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb
  - percent int not null default 0
  - updated_at timestamptz not null default now()

RLS policies (principles):
- Enable RLS on all three tables.
- Parents can SELECT their own links only: parent_user_id = auth.uid().
- Parents can INSERT pending link requests for themselves only (parent_user_id = auth.uid()).
- Parents cannot UPDATE status fields directly; approvals/denials only through RPC with SECURITY DEFINER.
- Invite codes are redeemed via RPC only; no direct INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE for public.
- Staff approvals occur via RPC that validates staff capability (principal/teacher) for the student’s school.

RPC endpoints (SECURITY DEFINER):
- create_parent_link_request(student_identifier text | invite_code text, relationship_type text)
- approve_parent_link(link_id uuid)
- deny_parent_link(link_id uuid, reason text)
- create_invite_code(student_id uuid, expires_at timestamptz)
- redeem_invite_code(code text)
- get_my_children()

DB Flow (happy paths):
1) Invite Code (fast path)
   - Staff creates invite code for a student.
   - Parent redeems code via `redeem_invite_code` → inserts approved link.
2) Request Link (no code)
   - Parent submits pending request via `create_parent_link_request`.
   - Staff reviews queue and approves/denies via RPC; audit timestamps are set.

Client Flow:
- Profile Wizard (/profiles-gate) collects parent info → Link Child screen
- Link Child options: Invite Code OR Request Link
- Parent Dashboard: if no children → show empty state + CTA to Link Child; show pending requests if any

Migration Rules [PROTECTED]:
- All migrations must be additive and idempotent (use IF NOT EXISTS where possible)
- Never drop columns/tables in mainline migrations; deprecate and clean up in dedicated, reviewed migrations
- One logical feature per migration file; name with UTC: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_parent_linking_schema.sql
- Always enable RLS and add minimum viable policies in the same migration that creates a table
- Staff operations must go through RPCs; avoid broad UPDATE/DELETE policies
- Every migration must be applied locally and in CI before merging; keep schema.sql in sync if used
