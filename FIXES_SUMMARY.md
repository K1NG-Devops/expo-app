# Fixes Applied - Access Denied & Contact Admin Button

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Access Denied Screen - Role Mismatch Issue
**Problem**: When users needed re-authentication, they were shown "Parent role is required" regardless of their actual role, which was misleading.

**Solution**: Modified the access logic to redirect users to the profile selection screen instead of showing misleading role-specific error messages.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/screens/parent-dashboard.tsx` - Updated access check logic to redirect to profile selection
- `locales/en/common.json` - Added more generic role-agnostic translations
- `app/profiles-gate.tsx` - Improved messaging for role setup issues

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Showed confusing parent role message
if (!canView || !hasAccess) {
  return <AccessDenied message="Parent role is required" />
}

// After: Redirects to proper profile selection
if (!canView || !hasAccess) {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    router.replace('/profiles-gate');
  }, []);
  return <RedirectingScreen />
}
```

### 2. âœ… Contact Super Admin Button in Principal Dashboard
**Problem**: Principals needed an easy way to contact super admin for support and assistance.

**Solution**: Added a prominent "Contact Super Admin" banner in the principal dashboard with multiple contact options.

**Files Modified**:
- `components/dashboard/EnhancedPrincipalDashboard.tsx` - Added contact admin banner
- Added comprehensive styles for the new banner component

**Features Added**:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Prominent Banner**: Green-themed contact banner positioned prominently in the dashboard
- ðŸ“ž **Multiple Contact Options**: Email support and live chat options
- ðŸ’¡ **Clear Messaging**: Explains what support team can help with
