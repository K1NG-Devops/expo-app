## ðŸš€ Database Migration Success

### âœ… Proper Migration Implementation
- [x] Created migration: `20250913010957_add_teacher_performance_metrics_table.sql`
- [x] Applied to remote database via `npx supabase db push`
- [x] Removed manual SQL files (following new RULES.md guidelines)
- [x] Local and remote databases now in sync

### ðŸ“Š Migration Results
```
âœ… teacher_performance_metrics table created
âœ… RLS policies configured  
âœ… Indexes added for performance
âœ… Sample data inserted for testing
âœ… Updated_at trigger configured
```
