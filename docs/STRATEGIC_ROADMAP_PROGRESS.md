# EduDash Pro – Strategic Roadmap Progress

A living progress log of milestones completed as we execute the roadmap. Append-only. Each milestone includes scope, verification, and follow-ups. Keep entries concise and practical.

---

## 2025-01-11 – Progress Log Initialized
- Created this file to capture working milestones with dates and verification steps.
- Baseline context: 91 TypeScript errors detected across 11 files after discovery; foundational supabase null-safety implemented via assertSupabase().
- Rule alignment: Will run `npm run typecheck` after each coding section before sign-off.

Verification:
- File present at docs/STRATEGIC_ROADMAP_PROGRESS.md
- Next: Add dashboard production-readiness analysis and commence Option A fixes.

---

## NEXT STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (TODO)
- [x] A1. Security/Auth TS cleanup (AuthContext, RBAC, Security, SessionManager, Security-audit)
- [x] A2. UI/Hook TS cleanup (Wireframes dashboards, MeetingRoom state, useDashboardData unions)
- [ ] B1. AI Gateway MVP (Teacher-first): harden lesson generator, grading assist, homework helper via feature flags and safe server proxy
- [ ] B2. Append progress after each milestone; run typecheck per rule
- [ ] C1. Principal Hub MVP planning: requirements, API/data needs, and rollout gates

---

## 2025-01-11 – Milestone: A1 + A2 Completed (TypeScript zero errors)
Scope:
- Replaced unsafe Supabase usage with assertSupabase() across security/auth layers (AuthContext, RBAC, Security, Security-audit, SessionManager)
- Fixed PostHog identify property types (removed undefineds)
- Resolved realtime service channel typings and cleanup
- Fixed MeetingRoom scheduling navigation bug (setActiveTab instead of undefined setter)
- Cleaned wireframe dashboards to use assertSupabase(); removed subquery misuse

Verification:
- npm run typecheck → 0 errors
- Minimal diff; no runtime behavior changes intended

Follow-ups:
- Monitor dashboards for runtime data loads
- Proceed to B1: Teacher-first AI Gateway wiring and safeguards

## 2025-01-11 – Dashboard Production-Readiness Assessment

Principal Dashboard (components/dashboard/PrincipalDashboard.tsx)
- Data correctness: uses usePrincipalDashboard hook. Ensure all queries tenant-scoped (preschool_id) and RLS-enforced. Good use of RealtimeActivityFeed for live updates.
- Performance: list sections are paginated or summarized; OK for mobile. Consider lazy-loading meeting room modal and activity feed.
- Offline: pull-to-refresh exists; recommend TanStack Query persistence for metrics.
- Observability: add track events for quick actions and error surfaces; maintain Sentry breadcrumb on errors.
- Security: ensure actions gated by RBAC (access_principal_hub, manage_teachers). Hide tools if missing capabilities.
- UX: touch targets >=44px; good contrast; multi-language selector present. Add empty states for metrics.

Teacher Dashboard (components/dashboard/TeacherDashboard.tsx)
- Data correctness: uses useTeacherDashboard hook (ensure tenant scoping and RLS). Metrics and cards map cleanly.
- Performance: grids are small; safe for mid-tier devices. For long class lists, flip to FlashList.
- Offline: pull-to-refresh present; recommend cached summaries (students/classes) with background refresh.
- Observability: added analytics for AI tool opens (lesson generator, homework grader).
- Security: gate AI features by feature flags and role capability (ai_lesson_generation, ai_grading_assistance) when enabling at scale.
- UX: status badges and progress bars are compact; ensure color contrast and screen reader labels.

Actions:
- Short-term: wire AI tools (done for navigation), add feature flag gating and loading states when enabling server proxy.
- Medium-term: add lazy routes for heavy sections, ensure i18n coverage for all strings.
