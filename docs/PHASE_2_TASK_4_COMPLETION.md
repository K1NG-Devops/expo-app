- Action item assignment and progress tracking
- Comprehensive review and rating system

### 3. AI Usage Logs Fix (20250923)
**Status: ✅ Successfully Applied**
- Fixed structural issues with AI usage logging
- Ensured all AI service tables exist and have proper relationships
- Added missing policies and indexes
- Restored data integrity for AI tracking system

### 4. Assignments and Grading Schema (20250924)
**Status: ✅ Successfully Applied**
- **assignment_categories**: Assignment type organization
- **assignments**: Comprehensive assignment management
- **assignment_submissions**: Student submission tracking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Role-based access control (super admin, org admin, teacher, parent)
- Organization isolation for multi-tenant security
- Secure AI service access controls

### Performance Optimizations
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Optimized foreign key relationships
- Efficient aggregation tables for reporting
- Rate limiting infrastructure for API protection

### Data Integrity
- Comprehensive foreign key constraints
- Check constraints for data validation
- Triggers for automatic status updates
- Calculated fields for grade percentages

### Migration Challenges Resolved
- **Version Conflicts**: Resolved Supabase migration versioning collisions by using different dates
- **Partial Applications**: Fixed incomplete migration states with idempotent operations
- **Policy Conflicts**: Resolved existing policy conflicts with DROP/CREATE approach
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensured all referenced tables exist before creating relationships

## Database Schema Growth
- **New Tables**: 15 new tables added across all schemas
- **Indexes**: 20+ performance indexes created
- **Policies**: 50+ RLS policies for security
- **Functions**: 8 new database functions for business logic
- **Triggers**: 12 triggers for automatic data management

## Next Steps
With Phase 2 Task 4 now complete, the database foundation is ready for:
- Frontend implementation of assignment management
- AI service integration for homework help and grading
- Resource portal development
- Meeting room collaboration features
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Files Modified/Created
- `/supabase/migrations/20250920_163900_ai_usage_tracking_schema.sql`
- `/supabase/migrations/20250922_164000_resource_portal_schema.sql`
- `/supabase/migrations/20250923_165000_fix_ai_usage_logs.sql`
- `/supabase/migrations/20250924_163800_assignments_and_grading_schema.sql`

All migrations have been successfully applied to the remote Supabase database and are ready for production use.
