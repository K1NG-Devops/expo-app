## 2. Areas of Improvement

### 2.1 Identified Flaws and Gaps

#### 2.1.1 **Critical Gaps (P1)**

**A. Hiring Hub Missing**
- **Business Impact:** Principals cannot manage teacher recruitment within EduDash Pro, forcing external tools (email, spreadsheets, paper applications)
- **Logic Gap:** No end-to-end hiring workflow from job posting → application collection → resume review → interview scheduling → offer generation
- **Data Model Required:**
  - Tables: `job_postings`, `job_applications`, `candidate_profiles`, `interview_schedules`, `hiring_decisions`
  - Storage: Resume files (PDF, DOCX), cover letters, certificates
  - Relationships: `job_applications.candidate_id → candidate_profiles.id`, `job_applications.job_posting_id → job_postings.id`
- **Recommendation:** Implement lightweight hiring hub with CV upload, application tracking, and interview scheduling (see Phase 1)

**B. Auto-Allocation System Missing**
- **Business Impact:** Principal manually assigns every student to classes and teachers, time-consuming for 100+ student schools
- **Logic Gap:** No algorithm for:
  - Balanced class sizes (within ±2 students)
  - Teacher workload distribution (max teaching hours, admin duties)
  - Schedule conflict detection (same teacher, multiple classes at same time)
  - Student requirements matching (special needs, age groups)
- **Data Model Required:**
  - Tables: `allocation_rules`, `allocation_history`, `teacher_workload_limits`
  - Computed columns: `classes.current_enrollment`, `teachers.total_teaching_hours`
- **Recommendation:** Build rule-based allocation engine with manual override (see Phase 1)

**C. Teacher Activity Monitoring Insufficient**
- **Business Impact:** Principals cannot proactively identify struggling teachers, delayed grading, or parent communication gaps
- **Logic Gap:** No real-time event stream for:
  - Lesson plan creation/updates
  - Assignment creation/grading progress
  - Parent messages sent/received
  - Attendance marking consistency
- **Data Model Required:**
  - Tables: `teacher_activity_logs`, `real_time_metrics`, `alert_thresholds`
  - Event types: `lesson_created`, `assignment_graded`, `message_sent`, `attendance_marked`
- **Recommendation:** Implement activity dashboard with configurable alerts (see Phase 1)

#### 2.1.2 **Enhancement Opportunities (P2)**

**D. Messaging Dashboard for Principals**
- **Current:** Principals see parent list but no unified inbox
- **Improvement:** Central dashboard showing:
  - All school conversations (teachers ↔ parents, principal ↔ teachers)
  - Unanswered parent messages (>24h response time alert)
  - Broadcast messaging capability (school announcements)
  - Message templates (permission slips, event notifications)

**E. Bulk Operations Limited**
- **Current:** Student allocation is one-by-one via dropdown
- **Improvement:** Batch operations:
  - CSV import for student class assignments
  - Drag-and-drop class roster management
  - Multi-select with bulk actions (reassign, archive, transfer)

**F. Homework Grading Principal View**
- **Current:** Teachers grade independently, principal has limited visibility
- **Improvement:** Principal dashboard showing:
  - Overdue grading (assignments >7 days ungraded)
  - Grading velocity per teacher (avg time to grade)
  - Inconsistent grading patterns (same assignment, different grade distributions)
  - Student performance trends requiring intervention

### 2.2 UX/Workflow Inefficiencies

| Issue | Impact | Screen | Recommendation | Effort |
|-------|--------|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Multi-step teacher invite** | 5 clicks to invite one teacher | `teacher-management.tsx` | One-click invite with pre-filled email, auto-send | 2 days |
| **No bulk student import** | Slow onboarding for new schools | `student-management.tsx` | CSV upload with field mapping wizard | 5 days |
| **Petty-cash lacks mobile receipt photo** | Teachers must upload from desktop | `petty-cash.tsx` | Native camera integration with auto-crop | 3 days |
| **Parent invite code copy-paste** | WhatsApp share works, but code copying has extra step | `principal-parent-invite-code.tsx` | One-tap copy with toast confirmation | 1 day |
| **Dashboard metrics not tappable** | User expects tap to drill-down | `EnhancedPrincipalDashboard.tsx` | Make all metric cards navigable to detail views | 3 days |
| **No offline indicator** | Unclear if data is stale when offline | All screens | Add sync status badge, show last updated timestamp | 2 days |
| **Search lacks filters** | Hard to find specific students/teachers in large lists | `student-management.tsx`, `teacher-management.tsx` | Add filter chips (status, class, subject) | 4 days |

**Total Effort for Quick Wins:** 20 days (4 weeks)

### 2.3 Business Logic Enhancements

#### A. Enrollment Pipeline Automation
- **Current:** Manual enrollment_applications review
- **Enhancement:** Auto-screening rules:
  - Age eligibility check (reject if outside grade range)
  - Capacity check (auto-waitlist if class full)
  - Document completeness (flag incomplete applications)
  - Duplicate detection (same parent/child combination)

#### B. Teacher Performance Metrics
- **Current:** Basic stats (classes, students)
- **Enhancement:** Comprehensive scorecard:
  - Grading turnaround time (benchmark: 3 days)
  - Parent communication responsiveness (benchmark: 24h)
  - Attendance marking consistency (daily vs. weekly)
  - Student performance trends in teacher's classes
  - Professional development hours completed

#### C. Financial Forecasting
- **Current:** Monthly revenue/expenses snapshot
- **Enhancement:** Predictive analytics:
  - Projected revenue based on enrollment pipeline
  - Churn risk analysis (payment delays, parent complaints)
  - Seasonal cash flow modeling (holidays, summer breaks)
  - Budget variance alerts (spend vs. plan)

#### D. Subscription Seat Management
- **Current:** Manual seat allocation, principal approves
- **Enhancement:** Automated workflows:
  - Auto-assign seat when teacher completes onboarding
  - Auto-revoke seat after 90 days inactivity
  - Seat usage analytics (active vs. idle seats)
  - Cost optimization recommendations (upgrade/downgrade plan)

| **Homework Grading** | ⚠️ Basic | 50% | `assignment_submissions`, `grades`, `grading_rubrics` | `POST /grade`<br>`ai-grading` function | Manual grading only, AI grading not integrated into workflow, no rubric builder, inline comments limited | Integrate AI grading UI into teacher dashboard, visual rubric editor, voice-to-text feedback, grading analytics (time per assignment) |
| **AI Quota Allocation** | ✅ Implemented | 90% | `school_ai_subscriptions`, `teacher_ai_allocations`, `ai_allocation_requests`, `ai_allocation_history`<br>Migration: `20250918155323_ai_quota_allocation_system.sql` | `GET /ai-quotas`<br>`POST /allocate-quota`<br>`POST /approve-request`<br>`lib/ai/allocation.ts` | Minor: No predictive quota needs, no overage handling (hard stop vs. soft limit) | Add predictive modeling (quota consumption forecasts), overage policies (pay-as-you-go, throttle), usage anomaly detection |
| **School Subscription** | ✅ Implemented | 85% | `organization_subscriptions`, `subscription_plans`, `teacher_seats`<br>Hooks: `useSeatLimits`, `useSubscription` | `GET /subscription`<br>`POST /upgrade`<br>`rpc-subscriptions.ts` | Billing integration manual (Stripe not auto-provisioned), usage-based billing not implemented | Automate Stripe provisioning, add usage-based billing tier (pay-per-student, pay-per-AI-call), self-service plan changes |

### 3.2 Educational Workflow Completeness

**End-to-End Flow Analysis:**

1. **Lesson Planning → Delivery → Assessment**
   - ✅ Teachers create lessons in Lessons Hub
   - ✅ Assign lessons as homework via `assign-homework.tsx`
   - ⚠️ Lesson delivery tracking incomplete (no "viewed by student" confirmation)
   - ⚠️ Assessment linked to lessons but not automatic (manual rubric mapping)
   - **Gap:** Unified lesson lifecycle tracking from creation → student engagement → grading → parent notification

2. **Student Progress Tracking**
   - ✅ Grades recorded per assignment
   - ⚠️ No progress dashboards for parents (they see grades but not trends)
   - ❌ No learning goals/competencies framework (standards alignment)
   - **Gap:** Competency-based progress tracking, parent-facing progress reports

3. **Parent Communication Loop**
   - ✅ Parents see assignments and grades
   - ✅ Messaging system exists
   - ⚠️ No automatic notifications (e.g., "Assignment graded" push notification)
   - ❌ No parent feedback collection (lesson satisfaction, teacher reviews)
   - **Gap:** Closed-loop communication with automated triggers and feedback capture

### 3.3 Actionable Recommendations

1. **Expand Activity Types:** Add 8 new activity types (Priority: P2, Effort: 6 weeks)
   - Interactive video with embedded quizzes
   - Digital whiteboard for math/drawing
   - Branching scenarios (choose-your-own-adventure)
   - Gamified challenges with leaderboards
   - Peer review activities (student grades student)
   - Voice/video response submissions
   - Virtual lab simulations
   - Collaborative group projects

2. **Implement Lesson Templates Library:** (Priority: P2, Effort: 4 weeks)
   - Curated library of 100+ lesson templates by grade/subject

   - Version control (track edits, revert to previous versions)

3. **Build Homework Grading Dashboard:** (Priority: P1, Effort: 5 weeks)
   - Principal view of all ungraded assignments (school-wide)
   - Teacher grading velocity metrics
   - AI-assisted grading integration (one-click AI suggestion → teacher review → finalize)
   - Bulk grading actions (grade all, apply rubric to batch)

4. **Create Parent Progress Portal:** (Priority: P2, Effort: 6 weeks)
   - Child-specific dashboard with grade trends, attendance, behavior notes
   - Skill-based progress (literacy, numeracy, social-emotional)
   - Automated weekly/monthly progress emails
   - Parent satisfaction surveys (post-grading, post-parent-teacher meetings)

5. **Integrate AI Quota with Homework Grading:** (Priority: P1, Effort: 3 weeks)
   - Deduct AI quota when teacher uses AI grading
   - Display quota balance before AI action (prevent mid-task failures)
   - Optimize quota consumption (batch grading uses less quota per item)

## 5. Implementation Priorities (Phased Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Critical Foundation (Q1 2026 – 12 weeks)

#### Epic 1.1: Hiring Hub
**Scope:** Complete teacher recruitment workflow within EduDash Pro

**User Stories:**
1. As a principal, I can create job postings (title, description, requirements, salary range)
2. As a teacher candidate, I can submit application with resume upload (PDF, DOCX)
3. As a principal, I can review applications, shortlist candidates, reject with reason
4. As a principal, I can schedule interviews (date/time, video link), send invite emails
5. As a principal, I can generate offer letters (template-based), track acceptance status

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Job postings table schema created with RLS policies
- [ ] Resume upload to Supabase Storage (50MB max per file)
- [ ] Application status workflow: `new` → `under_review` → `shortlisted` → `interview_scheduled` → `offered` → `accepted`/`rejected`
- [ ] Email notifications for status changes (candidate and principal)
- [x] Principal dashboard shows: active job postings, applications by status, interview calendar
- [x] Mobile-optimized UI (resume preview in-app, no external downloads)
- [ ] Search/filter candidates by skills, experience, location

**Required Data Structures:**
- Tables: `job_postings`, `job_applications`, `candidate_profiles`, `interview_schedules`, `offer_letters`
- Storage bucket: `candidate-resumes` (private, authenticated access only)
- Indexes: `job_applications(status, created_at)`, `candidate_profiles(email)`

**API Endpoints (new):**
- `POST /api/job-postings` – Create job posting
- `GET /api/job-postings/:id/applications` – List applications for job
- `POST /api/applications/:id/review` – Update application status
- `POST /api/interviews/schedule` – Schedule interview
- `POST /api/offers/generate` – Generate offer letter

**UI Surfaces:**
- [x] `app/screens/hiring-hub.tsx` – Principal dashboard (list jobs, applications)
- [x] `app/screens/job-posting-create.tsx` – Create/edit job posting
- [x] `app/screens/application-review.tsx` – Review candidate application with resume preview
- [ ] `app/screens/interview-scheduler.tsx` – Calendar-based interview scheduling
- [ ] Public route: `app/(public)/apply/[job_id].tsx` – Candidate application form

**Metrics:**
- Time-to-hire (days from job posting → offer accepted)
- Application completion rate (started vs. submitted)
- Interview show-up rate (scheduled vs. attended)
- Offer acceptance rate (offered vs. accepted)

**Risks:**
- Resume parsing complexity (optional: use AI to extract skills, experience)
- Email deliverability (candidate notifications may go to spam)
- Privacy compliance (GDPR/POPIA for candidate data retention)

**Effort Estimate:** 6 person-weeks (1 backend + 1 frontend + 1 QA)

---

#### Epic 1.2: Auto-Allocation Engine
**Scope:** Algorithmic allocation of students to classes and teachers with conflict detection

**User Stories:**
1. As a principal, I define allocation rules (max class size, teacher workload limits)
2. As a principal, I run auto-allocation for incoming cohort (100 students → 4 classes)
3. As a principal, I review proposed allocation (balanced classes, no conflicts)
4. As a principal, I manually override specific assignments (special needs, parent requests)
5. As a principal, I commit allocation (students assigned to classes in database)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Allocation rules configuration UI (max class size, teacher:student ratio, constraints)
- [ ] Auto-allocation algorithm balances class sizes within ±2 students
- [ ] Conflict detection: same teacher, multiple classes at same time
- [ ] Respect constraints: age groups, special needs, sibling same-class requests
- [ ] Preview mode shows proposed allocation before commit
- [ ] Allocation history tracked (who ran, when, rules used, students affected)
- [ ] Rollback capability (undo last allocation, restore previous state)
- [ ] Performance: allocate 500 students in <10 seconds

**Required Data Structures:**
- Tables: `allocation_rules`, `allocation_runs`, `allocation_history`, `teacher_workload_limits`
- Computed: `classes.current_enrollment`, `teachers.total_teaching_hours`
- Constraints: `class_capacity` (soft limit), `teacher_max_students` (hard limit)

**Algorithm Logic (High-Level):**
```
1. Load students (unassigned or reassignment mode)
2. Load classes (with capacity, current enrollment, teacher assigned)
3. Load teachers (with max student limit, current workload)
4. Sort students by priority (special needs, siblings, age)
5. For each student:
   a. Find eligible classes (age group match, capacity available, teacher not overloaded)
   b. Rank classes by balance score (closer to target size = higher score)
   c. Assign to highest-ranked class
   d. If conflicts (schedule, capacity), flag for manual review
6. Generate preview report (before/after counts, conflicts, unassigned students)
7. Await principal approval
8. On approval, commit assignments (update student.class_id, log history)
```

**API Endpoints (new):**
- `POST /api/allocations/run` – Execute allocation algorithm (returns preview)
- `POST /api/allocations/:id/commit` – Commit allocation
- `POST /api/allocations/:id/rollback` – Undo allocation
- `GET /api/allocation-history` – List past allocation runs

**UI Surfaces:**
- `app/screens/auto-allocation.tsx` – Configuration, run, preview, commit
- Modal: `components/AllocationPreview.tsx` – Before/after comparison table

**Metrics:**
- Allocation success rate (% students auto-assigned without conflicts)
- Time saved (manual allocation time vs. auto + review time)
- Class balance score (variance in class sizes)

**Risks:**
- Edge cases (e.g., 100 students, 3 classes, 1 class has special needs requirement)
- Algorithm complexity (NP-hard bin-packing problem, may need heuristics)
- Parent complaints (perceived unfairness in class assignments)

**Effort Estimate:** 8 person-weeks (1 algorithm developer + 1 frontend + 1 QA)

---

#### Epic 1.3: Enhanced Teacher Activity Monitoring
**Scope:** Real-time dashboard showing teacher actions, grading velocity, parent communication

**User Stories:**
1. As a principal, I see activity feed (last 50 teacher actions: lessons, assignments, messages)
2. As a principal, I filter activity by teacher, date range, action type
3. As a principal, I set alert thresholds (e.g., assignment ungraded >5 days)
4. As a principal, I receive notifications when thresholds breached (push, email)
5. As a principal, I view teacher performance scorecard (grading speed, message responsiveness)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Activity event stream captured for: lesson created, assignment created, assignment graded, message sent, attendance marked
- [ ] Real-time updates (WebSocket or Supabase Realtime subscriptions)
- [ ] Activity feed UI (infinite scroll, 50 items per page)
- [ ] Filter chips (teacher, action type, date range)
- [ ] Configurable alert rules (e.g., "Ungraded assignments >3 days" → alert)
- [ ] Push notifications to principal (mobile + web)
- [ ] Teacher scorecard (metrics: avg grading time, message response time, attendance consistency)
- [ ] Privacy: Teachers notified they're being monitored (transparency)

**Required Data Structures:**
- Tables: `teacher_activity_logs(teacher_id, action_type, entity_id, timestamp, metadata)`
- Indexes: `teacher_activity_logs(teacher_id, timestamp DESC)`, `teacher_activity_logs(action_type)`
- Alert rules table: `monitoring_alerts(rule_name, threshold, notification_channel, is_active)`
- Metrics rollup: `teacher_performance_metrics(teacher_id, avg_grading_hours, avg_response_hours, last_calculated)`

**Event Types:**
- `lesson_created`, `lesson_updated`, `lesson_deleted`
- `assignment_created`, `assignment_graded`, `assignment_feedback_added`
- `message_sent`, `message_read`
- `attendance_marked`, `attendance_updated`
- `parent_meeting_scheduled`, `report_card_generated`

**API Endpoints (new):**
- `GET /api/activity-feed` – Fetch activity logs (paginated, filtered)
- `GET /api/teacher-metrics/:teacher_id` – Fetch performance scorecard
- `POST /api/monitoring-alerts` – Create alert rule
- `GET /api/monitoring-alerts/triggered` – List active alerts

**UI Surfaces:**
- `app/screens/teacher-monitoring.tsx` – Activity feed + filters
- `app/screens/teacher-scorecard/:teacher_id.tsx` – Individual teacher metrics
- Modal: `components/AlertConfigModal.tsx` – Configure alert rules

**Metrics:**
- Alert accuracy (% of alerts that result in principal action)
- Principal time saved (proactive intervention vs. reactive problem-solving)
- Teacher satisfaction (perception of monitoring: supportive vs. invasive)

**Risks:**
- Privacy concerns (teachers feel surveillance pressure)
- Alert fatigue (too many false positives)
- Performance (high-frequency event capture may slow system)

**Effort Estimate:** 7 person-weeks (1 backend + 1 frontend + 1 QA)

### 6.3 Cost Sensitivity Analysis

**Key Cost Drivers:**
1. **AI API costs** (35-50% of infra cost) – Highly variable based on:
   - Teacher adoption (50 calls/month is avg; power users may use 200+)
   - Prompt engineering efficiency (reduce tokens per call by 30% → 30% cost savings)
   - Model selection (Claude Haiku vs. Sonnet: 5x price difference)

2. **Database queries** (15-25% of infra cost) – Optimize by:
   - Aggressive caching (TanStack Query already implemented)
   - Reduce polling (use Realtime subscriptions for live data)
   - Index optimization (135 migrations reviewed, indexes present but may need tuning)

3. **Support costs** (5-10% of infra cost) – Scale with user base:
   - Small schools: higher % (manual onboarding, lots of questions)
   - Large schools: lower % (self-service, peer support)

**Cost Reduction Strategies:**
1. **AI Quota Hard Limits:** Prevent runaway costs (auto-throttle at 110% of allocated quota)
2. **Model Tiering:** Default to Claude Haiku (cheap), upgrade to Sonnet for complex tasks
3. **Batch Processing:** Grade 20 assignments in one AI call (shared context, lower per-item cost)
4. **Caching AI Responses:** Cache common AI outputs (e.g., lesson templates, rubric suggestions) – 30% cache hit rate = 30% cost reduction
5. **Usage-Based Pricing:** Pass AI costs to schools (pay-per-AI-call tier for power users)

| **Privacy/Regulatory (FERPA, GDPR, POPIA)** | High | Critical | - Data residency options (EU, ZA regions)<br>- Configurable data retention policies<br>- Anonymization for analytics<br>- Audit trails for data access<br>- Parent consent management | Legal + Engineering |
| **Vendor Lock-in (Supabase, Claude API)** | Medium | High | - Abstraction layers (don't tightly couple to Supabase)<br>- Multi-cloud strategy (optional: AWS RDS fallback)<br>- AI vendor abstraction (support OpenAI, Gemini as alternatives) | CTO |
| **AI Model Drift** | Medium | Medium | - Version lock AI models (pin Claude version)<br>- Regression testing (sample grading outputs)<br>- Fallback to manual grading if AI quality degrades | AI Lead |
| **Cost Overruns (AI usage spikes)** | Medium | High | - Hard quota limits (auto-throttle at 110% allocated)<br>- Usage alerts (notify principal at 80%, 100%)<br>- Cost forecasting dashboard (project monthly spend) | CFO + Product |
| **Data Loss (accidental deletion)** | Low | Critical | - Soft deletes (mark as deleted, retain 90 days)<br>- Automated backups (daily, 30-day retention)<br>- Point-in-time recovery (Supabase Pro feature) | DevOps |
| **Security Breach (unauthorized access)** | Low | Critical | - RLS enforcement (all tables)<br>- Penetration testing (annual)<br>- Bug bounty program (responsible disclosure)<br>- SOC 2 compliance (if targeting enterprise) | Security Lead |

---

### 8.2 Data Governance Framework

#### A. Roles and Responsibilities
| Role | Access Level | Responsibilities |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **Super Admin** | Full system access | Create/delete organizations, manage subscriptions, support escalations |
| **Principal** | School-wide access | Manage teachers, students, parents, financial data within own school |
| **Teacher** | Class-level access | Manage own classes, assignments, grades; view own students' data |
| **Parent** | Child-specific access | View own children's grades, assignments, attendance, messages |
| **Student** | Self-only access | View own assignments, grades, lessons (if student portal implemented) |

#### B. RLS Policy Enforcement
**Current Status:** ✅ RLS policies implemented across 135 migrations
**Validation Approach:**
- Automated tests (unit tests for each policy)
- Manual audits (quarterly RLS review)
- Policy linter (detect missing RLS on new tables)

**Policy Pattern Examples:**
```
-- Principals see only their school's data
CREATE POLICY "principals_view_own_school" ON teachers
  FOR SELECT USING (preschool_id = get_current_preschool_id());

-- Teachers see only their own classes
CREATE POLICY "teachers_view_own_classes" ON assignments
  FOR SELECT USING (teacher_id = auth.uid());

-- Parents see only their children's data
CREATE POLICY "parents_view_own_children" ON students
  FOR SELECT USING (parent_id = auth.uid() OR guardian_id = auth.uid());
```

#### C. PII Mapping
**Sensitive Data Inventory:**
| Data Type | Tables | Columns | Retention Policy | Anonymization |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Student Names | `students` | `first_name`, `last_name` | Until graduation + 5 years | Pseudonymize after graduation |
| Parent Contact | `users` (parents) | `email`, `phone`, `address` | Until account deletion + 1 year | Hash after deletion |
| Teacher SSN/ID | `teachers` | `id_number`, `bank_account` | Until employment end + 7 years | Encrypt at rest |
| Payment Data | `financial_transactions` | `amount`, `payment_method` | 7 years (tax compliance) | Anonymize after retention period |
| Grades/Transcripts | `grades`, `report_cards` | `grade`, `comments` | Permanent (student record) | Redact teacher names after 5 years |

**Automated Retention:**
- Cron job deletes soft-deleted records after 90 days
- Anonymization script runs quarterly (hashes PII beyond retention period)
- Export API for data portability (GDPR "right to data portability")

## 10. Appendix

### 10.1 Methodology

**Approach:**
1. **Codebase Audit:** Scanned 135 database migrations, 200+ React Native screens, 50+ service files
2. **Feature Verification:** Triangulated code references (file paths, table names, API routes) with expected functionality
3. **Maturity Assessment:** Evaluated each feature on 4 criteria:
   - **Functional:** Does it work as intended?
   - **Complete:** Are all edge cases handled?
   - **Scalable:** Can it handle 10x growth?
   - **Delightful:** Is the UX polished?
4. **Competitive Analysis:** Compared feature-by-feature against Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams Edu, Canvas
5. **Cost Modeling:** Built bottom-up cost estimates (Supabase pricing, AI API usage, storage) for 3 scenarios
6. **Prioritization:** Ranked by business impact (revenue, differentiation, risk mitigation) vs. effort

**Evidence Standards:**
- All claims backed by code references (file paths, table names, component names)
- No code snippets (per requirement: high-level business logic focus)
- Status labels: ✅ Implemented, ⚠️ Partial, ❌ Missing

**Validation:**
- Cross-checked table schema (supabase/migrations) with UI usage (app/screens)
- Confirmed API routes exist (lib/services, supabase/functions)
- Verified RLS policies (grep for "CREATE POLICY")

### 10.2 Assumptions

1. **Pricing Model:** $15/teacher/month (school pays, not individual teachers)
2. **Retention:** 24-month average customer lifetime (schools don't churn frequently)
3. **AI Usage:** 50 AI calls/teacher/month (grading + lesson generation)
4. **Support Costs:** 5-10% of infrastructure costs (scales with school size)
5. **Development Velocity:** 1 person-week = $1,500 fully loaded cost (salary + benefits + overhead)
6. **Market Penetration:** 10% of target market (5,000 schools) within 3 years
7. **Supabase Performance:** Handles 30M queries/month per school without major overages
8. **AI Accuracy:** Claude grading matches human grading 85% of the time (acceptable with teacher review)
9. **Parent WhatsApp Adoption:** 80% of parents prefer WhatsApp over email (South African market)
10. **Mobile Usage:** 70% of principals use mobile app as primary interface (vs. desktop web)
