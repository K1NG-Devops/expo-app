  priority TEXT DEFAULT 'normal' CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'normal', 'high', 'urgent')),
  scheduled_for TIMESTAMPTZ,
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  is_published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE financial_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

);
```

### Capability Gating & RLS Checks

#### RBAC Permissions Required
```typescript
// Principal Hub capabilities
const PRINCIPAL_HUB_CAPABILITIES = [
  'access_principal_hub',         // Basic hub access
  'view_school_analytics',        // Dashboard metrics
  'manage_teachers',              // Teacher oversight
  'manage_announcements',         // Communication tools
  'view_financial_reports',       // Financial dashboard
  'manage_student_applications',  // Enrollment management
  'manage_school_settings',       // Configuration access
] as const;

// RLS Helper Updates Needed
// Add to existing has_role_in_preschool function:
const principalRoles = ['principal', 'principal_admin', 'super_admin'];
```

#### Progressive Feature Rollout
```typescript
// Feature flags for Principal Hub
const PRINCIPAL_HUB_FEATURES = {
  basic_dashboard: true,           // Always enabled for principals
  teacher_management: true,        // MVP feature
  financial_reporting: false,     // Phase 2 (enable per org)
  advanced_analytics: false,      // Phase 3 (Premium tier only)
  meeting_room: false,            // Phase 4 (Enterprise feature)
} as const;
```

## Rollout Gates & Success Criteria

### Quality Gates
1. **Security**: All RLS policies tested and validated
2. **Performance**: Page load times < 2 seconds
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
4. **Mobile**: Responsive design on all device sizes
5. **Data Integrity**: Financial calculations verified against test data

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: >80% of principals log in weekly within first month
- **Engagement**: Average session duration >5 minutes
- **Task Completion**: >90% success rate for core workflows
- **Performance**: <1% error rate for data operations
- **Feedback**: Net Promoter Score >7/10 from principal users

### Rollout Strategy
1. **Alpha** (Week 1): Internal testing with 2-3 test principals
2. **Beta** (Week 2): Limited rollout to 10 pilot schools
3. **GA** (Week 3): Full rollout with feature flags enabled
4. **Optimization** (Week 4): Performance tuning and feedback integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Pre-optimize queries, implement caching
- **RLS Complexity**: Thorough testing with test accounts per role
- **Real-time Updates**: Fallback to polling if WebSocket fails
- **Mobile Performance**: Progressive loading, lazy routes

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Comprehensive onboarding flow and training materials
- **Data Accuracy**: Validation rules and reconciliation processes
- **Compliance**: Regular audit trails and data retention policies
