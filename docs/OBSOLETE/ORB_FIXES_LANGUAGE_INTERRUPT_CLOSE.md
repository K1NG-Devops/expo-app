# Orb Fixes: Language, Interrupt, and Close Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Dash Speaks in Wrong Language (Afrikaans instead of English)

**Problem:**
- User sets language to English in settings
- Orb input language is English
- But Dash responds in Afrikaans

**Root Cause:**
DashAIAssistant's `speakResponse()` gets language from `voice_preferences` table which had `af` saved, overriding the orb's language setting.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Override response language to match orb language for TTS
if (response.metadata) {
  response.metadata.detected_language = activeLang;
} else {
  response.metadata = { detected_language: activeLang };
}
```

**Additionally:**
- Save orb language to database on session start
- Ensures future sessions use correct language persistently

**File:** `components/ai/DashVoiceMode.tsx` lines 167-174, 309-317

### 2. ✅ Interrupt Detection Not Working

**Problem:**
- User starts speaking while Dash is talking
- Dash continues talking (doesn't stop)
- No haptic feedback for interruption

**Root Cause:**
- Interrupt threshold too high (`partial.length > 0` but needed more sensitivity)
- No haptic feedback
- Only triggered on partial transcripts

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Improved sensitivity: interrupt on 2+ characters
if (speaking && partial.length >= 2) {
  console.log('[DashVoiceMode] 🛑 User interrupted - stopping TTS');
  setSpeaking(false);
  dashInstance?.stopSpeaking?.(); // Device TTS
  audioManager.stop(); // Edge Function TTS
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light); // Feedback
}
```

**Improvements:**
- Lower threshold (2 characters instead of > 0)
- Added haptic feedback
- Stops both device TTS and audio manager

**File:** `components/ai/DashVoiceMode.tsx` lines 101-119

### 3. ✅ Closing Modal Doesn't Stop Dash

**Problem:**
- User closes orb modal
- Dash keeps talking in background
- No way to stop playback

**Root Cause:**
`handleClose()` only stopped streaming, not TTS playback.

**Fix:**
```typescript
const handleClose = async () => {
  // Stop streaming
  try { await realtime.stopStream(); } catch {}
  
  // Stop TTS playback
  console.log('[DashVoiceMode] 🛑 Stopping TTS on close');
  setSpeaking(false);
  try {
    dashInstance?.stopSpeaking?.(); // Device TTS
    const { audioManager } = await import('@/lib/voice/audio');
    await audioManager.stop(); // Edge Function TTS
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('[DashVoiceMode] ⚠️ Error stopping TTS:', e);
  }
  
  try { Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light); } catch {}
  onClose();
};
```

**File:** `components/ai/DashVoiceMode.tsx` lines 383-403

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Language Override ✅

```bash
# 1. Set Dash AI Settings → Voice Language to English (SA)
# 2. Open orb
# Expected: Language saved to database as 'en-ZA'

# 3. Speak in English: "Hello Dash"
# Expected: Dash responds in English
# Log: [DashVoiceMode] 📢 TTS will use language: en
```

### Test 2: Interrupt Detection ✅

```bash
# 1. Open orb
# 2. Speak: "Tell me a long story"
# 3. While Dash is speaking, say: "Stop"

# Expected:
# - Dash stops immediately after 2+ chars detected
# - Haptic feedback occurs
# - Log: [DashVoiceMode] 🛑 User interrupted - stopping TTS
```

### Test 3: Close Stops TTS ✅

```bash
# 1. Open orb
# 2. Speak: "Tell me about something"
# 3. While Dash is responding, tap X button to close

# Expected:
# - Orb closes
# - TTS stops immediately
# - No background audio continues
# - Log: [DashVoiceMode] 🛑 Stopping TTS on close
```

## Implementation Details

### Language Priority System

**For Input (Transcription):**
```
1. forcedLanguage prop
2. preferences?.language (from voice_preferences table)
3. i18n?.language (UI language)
```

**For Output (TTS):**
```typescript
// Before fix:
1. voiceService.getPreferences() // ❌ Had 'af' saved
2. message.metadata.detected_language
3. text heuristic
4. personality default

// After fix:
0. response.metadata.detected_language (orb override) // ✅ NEW!
1. voiceService.getPreferences() (now synced with orb)
2. message.metadata.detected_language
3. text heuristic
4. personality default
```

### Audio Manager Integration

The orb uses two TTS systems:
1. **expo-speech** (Device TTS) - Fallback
2. **audioManager** (Edge Function TTS via Azure) - Primary

Both must be stopped on:
- Interrupt
- Close
- Error

## Known Limitations

### Database Language Persistence

If you previously had Afrikaans saved in `voice_preferences`, the first time you open the orb after this fix, it will:
1. Use Afrikaans from database (old setting)
2. Override response to English (new fix)
3. Save English to database (for next time)

**Subsequent sessions will use English correctly from the start.**

### Manual Database Fix (Optional)

If you want immediate effect without waiting for orb to save:

```sql
-- Check current language
SELECT language_code FROM voice_preferences 
WHERE user_id = '<your-user-id>';

-- Update to English
UPDATE voice_preferences 
SET language_code = 'en', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = '<your-user-id>';
```

## Architecture Notes

### Why Not Change sendMessage Signature?

We considered:
```typescript
sendMessage(content: string, metadata?: { language: string })
```

**Rejected because:**
- Would require updating all sendMessage callers
- Language is TTS concern, not message content concern
- Cleaner to override at TTS layer (response.metadata)

### Why Save Language on Every Session?

```typescript
// Save orb language preference on session start
await voiceService.savePreferences({ language: activeLang });
```

**Benefits:**
- User expectation: orb language = TTS language
- Persists across app restarts
- Syncs with voice preferences in settings
- Non-blocking (won't delay streaming start)
