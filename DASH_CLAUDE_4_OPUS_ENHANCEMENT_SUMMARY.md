## 🧠 Advanced Reasoning Examples

### Before (Basic)
```
User: "Help me create a lesson on fractions"
Dash: "Here's a basic lesson plan for fractions..."
```

### After (Claude 4 Opus Level)
```
User: "Help me create a lesson on fractions"
Dash: "I'll create a comprehensive lesson on fractions. Based on your previous lessons, I notice you prefer hands-on activities. Let me analyze your curriculum standards and suggest a multi-step approach:

1. **Deep Analysis**: Breaking down fraction concepts into fundamental components
2. **Extended Thinking**: Considering multiple learning styles and pedagogical approaches  
3. **Contextual Reasoning**: Adapting to your Grade 3 class and CAPS curriculum
4. **Creative Problem-Solving**: Developing innovative activities that engage students
5. **Assessment Integration**: Designing formative and summative assessments

I've also found 5 related resources from your previous lessons and 3 web resources that align perfectly. Would you like me to:
- Generate a detailed lesson plan with activities?
- Search for additional visual aids?
- Create assessment rubrics?
- Schedule follow-up activities?"
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Memory System
```typescript
// Advanced semantic memory with embeddings
const memory = await dashAdvancedMemory.storeMemory(
  'insight',
  'user_prefers_hands_on_activities',

    tags: ['preference', 'teaching_style'],
    related_entities: [{ type: 'user', id: 'user_123', relevance_score: 1.0 }]
  }
);
```

### Tool Integration
```typescript
// Intelligent tool suggestion and execution
const suggestions = await dashToolIntegration.suggestTools(
  'lesson_planning_context',
  'Help me find resources for teaching fractions'
);

const result = await dashToolIntegration.executeTool('web_search', {
  query: 'fraction teaching resources Grade 3',
  max_results: 10,
  safe_search: true
});
```
