## üö® If Tests Fail

If you still get irrelevant responses or filler phrases:

   ```bash
   git pull origin [branch-name]
   grep -n "BANNED PHRASES" services/DashAIAssistant.ts
   # Should show 2 matches at lines ~3324 and elsewhere
   ```

2. **Rebuild the app:**
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and rebuild
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Check if AI cache needs clearing:**
   - The AI service might be caching old prompts
   - Wait 5 minutes or restart the AI service
